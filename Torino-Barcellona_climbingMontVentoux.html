      </ul>

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <p> I started this journey with my friend Francesco and zero experience in multiday adventures. When we got off the train we noticed that the weather was a little ugly, cold and cloudy. After some kilometers it started raining, so we asked for some trash bags in a bar to better protect our sleeping gear.
        Monginevro was the first climb. The ascent was easy, but the descent was not â€” it was so cold. Freezing in July is the best way to start sumemr holidays.
        After a long stop in BrianÃ§on and some slices of a sweet French pizza (I donâ€™t know, but it was good), we cycled until we reached Lake Embrun. We stopped at the beginning and went to a camping site. I had a recovery bath in the lake because it became sunny. Dinner was from a supermarket.

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <p>The morning didn't started in the best way, it was very cold and our clothes were wet so we stayed in 
        our sleeping bag for 2 hours after waking up. We left very late in the morning and started cycling near the lake, it was very very long.
        It was a little bit difficult, a continuos up and down, natural hills or overpasses, each kilometer first went up and then down. 
        We climbed Col du Perty with a nice view and scent of lavender fields, always cloudly with a storm nearby. We arrived after
        dinner in our Airbnb. The village was very very small, only few houses, no supermarkets, restaurants or other shops.

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <p> In the morning ride to the supermarket. After lunch we talked about the future of our journey. We were tired of
        feeling cold, the original plan was to follow the Tour de France but we should have gone in mountain roads, like 
        Col de la Loze or Col de l'Iseran where the forecast showed snow for the next few days. We opened Google Maps and saw 
        that Spain was relatively close and sunny. We only had a shirt and a shor trouser so we decided to go to Barcelona.

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <p>Finally in one of the most famous mountains for cyclists. After a good breakfast we started approaching the climb 
        doing 40km. The number of bikes increased and in fact the climb was very busy, important day in France. Without our
        bags the bike was very light and the climb easy. Arrived on the top we descent a little bit to find a good spot and wait
        the Tour. It was a little bit windy and not so hot, the lunch very poor, with only an energetic bar and a banana.
        Francesco realized his tire was broken and during the descent the inner tube exploded. After fixing it with scotch we urgently 
        looked for a bike shop and bought a new tire before it closed.

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <p>Let's say goodbye to our little house to start a flat ride passing through some bigger cities like Orange 
        and Nimes. The last part was a very long bike path that took us to a camping site. At first it was full, but then the owner let us camp in the garden of a small house that was empty at the moment.

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <p> We paid 1 euro for 1h30min train from Montpellier to Perpignan, bike transport free. We couldn't not do it.
        After asking Strava to two girls we met on the train who never accepted our request we started moving very excited 
        for the entrance in Spain, our first crossing of a country that does not border Italy. After the photo at the sign 
     we quickly went down to the first city (Figueres) between trucks. while we were standing on a sidewalk a man came out of a pizzeria thinking we had punctured the wheel. 
     We discovered that he was Italian, Sardinian. He let us in and we ate a good pizza made by a man from Naples. Best way to enter in Spain.
     Then we continued to Girona where we slept in the hostel and ate in the best Indian restaurant ever tasted.

      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <p> After trying to understand which are the most famous roads in the area we opted to follow a route on Komoot. 
        We climbed Tibidabo and Forat del Vent. Very nice streets full of bikes since it was Sunday. If you are here by bike I recommend not sleeping in the city center but staying for example in these hilly areas, better to experience the bike and stay calmer.
        Tibidabo is the "Spanish Superga", the famous church in Turin.

        to return directly at home. We played footbal with some children, it was funny and tiring, maybe more than a stage of our journey.
